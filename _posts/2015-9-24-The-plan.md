title: The plan
---

I intended this to be a tech blog but looks like this is probably going to be a travelogue.
Whatever it turns out to be I intend to start writing more.

I am going to list my plan down, more as a note to myself than anything else.
Putting things out in the open seem to motivate me more.

## The dream

- Visit 30 countries before I turn 30

## The plan

So the plan is to get a multi entry Schengen visa and then visit all the Schengen countries. That alone gets me nearly 28 countries I guess.
I have already covered Austria in a skiing trip last winter. I should probably write about that trip.
And I am in the UK and I was in India. So that puts the total number of countries that I have been to so far at 3

1. India
2. United Kingdom
3. Austria

Also I need a driving licence if I am to rent a car. I can't use the Indian driving licence as I can only use it for a year
of stay in the UK and after that I have to get a UK driving licence. That work is in progress, I have got a learners
and I have a theory exam coming up this Saturday. I should have a driving licence in a month or two.

I hear France is the easiest to visit over a weekend from the UK and the easiest to get a multi entry visa. So next step is
to plan a weekend trip to Paris and get that visa. I had already done one for the Austria trip but I didn't bother to get a
multientry then, I should have done it then. Anyway exciting times ahead.

Ps: I guess I should go back and start learning some basic punctuation and grammar. Procrastination kicking in, this will do for now.
