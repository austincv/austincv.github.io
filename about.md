Most of my life was spent in south India in a small city called [Pondicherry]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry), now called Puducherry though.
I am originally from a neighbouring state called [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala).
You might have seen it on ads for tourists as "[God's Own Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God's_Own_Country#Kerala.2C_India)".
It is a beautiful place and definitely worth a visit.

After grabbing my Engineering degree in [Electronics and Instrumentation](http://www.pec.edu/),
I worked for [Mu-Sigma](http://www.mu-sigma.com/) as an Analyst in 
their [Innovation and Development Lab](http://www.mu-sigma.com/analytics/ecosystem/innovation.html).
I was part of a small group that did research on the applications of Hadoop and related Big Data technologies.
I also did some hobby robotics and Image processing in my spare time. Anyway, all of that and some serendipity
has led to my current gig here in London. I love that word serendipity, I had to put it in here somehow. 

I am currently a Big Data Engineer at [Big Data Partnership](http://bigdatapartnership.com).
